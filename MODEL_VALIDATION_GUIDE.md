# Model Validation & Overfitting Prevention Guide

## Current State Analysis

Your codebase already implements several good practices:
- ✅ Time Series Cross-Validation (TimeSeriesSplit)
- ✅ Early stopping for gradient boosting
- ✅ L1/L2 regularization
- ✅ Feature selection
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning framework

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Validation Strategy Enhancements

#### Current Issues:
- Training on full dataset after CV may overfit
- No held-out test set for final validation
- Limited out-of-time validation

#### Recommended Improvements:
- Use walk-forward validation for time series
- Keep a strict held-out test set (last 10-15% of data)
- Monitor validation curves for overfitting signals
- Implement learning curves to detect underfitting/overfitting

### 2. Overfitting Detection Metrics

Track these key indicators:
- **Train vs Validation Gap**: If train performance >> validation performance → overfitting
- **Validation Curve Stability**: Sharp drops indicate overfitting
- **Feature Importance Stability**: Unstable features across CV folds → overfitting
- **Prediction Distribution**: Out-of-distribution predictions → poor generalization

### 3. Model Performance Optimization

#### Regularization Techniques:
1. **L1/L2 Regularization** (already implemented)
   - Increase lambda_l1 and lambda_l2 if overfitting detected
   
2. **Dropout for Neural Networks**
   - Use 0.2-0.4 dropout rate
   
3. **Early Stopping** (already implemented)
   - Ensure patience (stopping_rounds) is appropriate
   
4. **Max Depth/Complexity Control**
   - Limit tree depth: max_depth=5-8 instead of -1
   - Reduce num_leaves: 31 → 15-20
   
5. **Bagging/Feature Subsampling**
   - feature_fraction: 0.6-0.8
   - bagging_fraction: 0.6-0.8

#### Data Quality:
1. **Remove Outliers**: Extreme values can cause overfitting
2. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize/standardize features
3. **Handle Missing Values Properly**: Forward fill may introduce look-ahead bias

#### Feature Engineering:
1. **Feature Selection**: Reduce feature count (already implemented)
2. **Cross-Validation Stability**: Select features consistent across folds
3. **Remove Redundant Features**: High correlation filtering (already implemented)

### 4. Walk-Forward Validation

This is the gold standard for time series:
```
Train Set 1 → Test Set 1
Train Set 1+2 → Test Set 2
Train Set 1+2+3 → Test Set 3
...
```

### 5. Model Monitoring Dashboard

Track these metrics over time:
- RMSE (train vs validation)
- Correlation (train vs validation)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Prediction distribution statistics
- Feature importance stability
- Model confidence/uncertainty

### 6. Ensemble Best Practices

Your ensemble framework is good, but ensure:
- Base models are diverse (different algorithms, parameters)
- Use out-of-fold predictions for stacking
- Monitor individual model performance
- Weight models by recent performance

## Quick Actions to Take Now

1. **Run the validation script** (see `notebooks/04_comprehensive_validation.py`)
2. **Check for overfitting signals**:
   - If train RMSE < 0.001 but validation RMSE > 0.01 → severe overfitting
   - If correlation on train > 0.9 but validation < 0.3 → overfitting
3. **Tune regularization** if overfitting detected
4. **Reduce model complexity** (fewer features, shallower trees)
5. **Use ensemble predictions** (generally more robust)

## Recommended Hyperparameters to Prevent Overfitting

```python
# Conservative LightGBM parameters
params = {
    'objective': 'regression',
    'metric': 'rmse',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 20,              # Reduced from 31
    'learning_rate': 0.03,          # Lower learning rate
    'feature_fraction': 0.7,        # Increased regularization
    'bagging_fraction': 0.7,        # Increased regularization
    'bagging_freq': 5,
    'max_depth': 6,                 # Explicit depth limit
    'min_data_in_leaf': 50,         # Increased from 20
    'lambda_l1': 0.5,               # Increased regularization
    'lambda_l2': 0.5,               # Increased regularization
    'min_gain_to_split': 0.01,     # Prevent unnecessary splits
    'verbose': -1,
    'seed': 42
}
```

## Warning Signs of Overfitting

1. **Performance Gap**: Training RMSE << Validation RMSE
2. **Unstable Features**: Feature importance changes drastically across folds
3. **Too Many Features**: Using 100+ features on 2000 samples
4. **Perfect Training Performance**: Correlation > 0.95 on training set
5. **Complex Models**: Very deep trees (depth > 10) or many estimators
6. **Out-of-Distribution Predictions**: Predictions outside reasonable range
