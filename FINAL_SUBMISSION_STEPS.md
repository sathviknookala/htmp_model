## 📋 Remaining Steps

### Step 3: Upload Models to Kaggle

**Option A: Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
2. Click "New Dataset"
3. Upload ALL files from `models/` folder:
   - gbm_model.txt
   - gbm_model.txt.metadata
   - xgb_model.json
   - xgb_model.json.metadata
   - feature_engineer.pkl
   - feature_selector.pkl
   - allocation_strategy.pkl
   - model_metadata.pkl
   - ensemble.pkl
   - dataset-metadata.json

4. Set:
   - **Title**: Hull Tactical Models
   - **Subtitle**: LightGBM + XGBoost ensemble with feature selection
   
5. Click "Create"

6. Your dataset will be at:
   ```
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eshaanganguly/hull-tactical-models
   ```

**Option B: Kaggle CLI** (if you have it configured)
```bash
cd models
kaggle datasets create
cd ..
```

### Step 4: Create Submission Notebook on Kaggle

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/code
2. Click "New Notebook"
3. Click the "+" on the right sidebar to add data
4. Add your datasets:
   - Search and add: `eshaanganguly/hull-tactical-models`
   - Search and add: `hull-tactical-market-prediction` (competition data)
5. Delete the default code
6. Copy the entire contents of `kaggle_submission_ensemble.py`
7. Paste into the notebook
8. Settings (gear icon on right):
   - Enable "Internet": OFF
   - Enable "GPU": OFF
9. Click "Save Version" → "Save & Run All"

### Step 5: Submit to Competition

After your notebook finishes running (20-60 minutes):

1. Go to your notebook
2. Check the logs for "✓ Predictor ready!"
3. In the notebook, click "Submit to Competition" (top right)
4. Add submission message: "LightGBM + XGBoost ensemble with confidence-based allocation"
5. Click "Submit"

## 🔍 Verify Your Submission

Check your notebook output for these success indicators:

```
✓ LightGBM loaded
✓ XGBoost loaded
✓ Feature engineer loaded
✓ Ensemble mode: 2 models
✓ Predictor ready!
```

And during predictions:
```
Prediction #100:
  Models: ['lightgbm', 'xgboost']
  Ensemble: 0.001234
  Confidence: 0.850
  Allocation: 1.2345
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Dataset not found:**
- Ensure dataset finished uploading/processing on Kaggle
- Check dataset is public or added to notebook
- Verify path: `/kaggle/input/eshaanganguly-hull-tactical-models`

**Import errors:**
- All required packages are in the Kaggle environment
- No need to pip install anything

**Memory errors:**
- Should not happen with our optimized code
- If it does, the model loads only 500 recent samples

**Timeout:**
- Notebook should complete in 30-60 minutes
- If timeout, try submitting during off-peak hours
