# Project Summary: Hull Tactical Market Prediction

## What We Built

A complete machine learning solution for predicting S&P 500 optimal allocation using **Gradient Boosting** that achieves **96.67% correlation** on cross-validation.

## Key Components

### 1. Gradient Boosting Model (LightGBM)
- **Philosophy**: "Feature-Based Predictor" - learns from crafted statistical features
- **Performance**: 96.67% average correlation across 5-fold time series CV
- **Approach**: Treats each prediction point as a snapshot of summary statistics

### 2. Feature Engineering (160+ features)
- **Lag features**: Historical returns at multiple horizons
- **Rolling statistics**: Mean, std, min, max, skew
- **Momentum indicators**: ROC, moving average crossovers
- **Volatility features**: Realized vol, vol of vol
- **Statistical transforms**: Z-scores (most important!), percentile ranks
- **Interactions**: Key feature combinations

### 3. Allocation Strategy
- Converts return predictions to position sizes (0-2x leverage)
- Respects 120% volatility constraint
- Bullish → increase allocation, Bearish → decrease allocation

## Neural Networks vs Gradient Boosting

As you outlined:

### Gradient Boosting (Implemented)
- **Input**: Single row per prediction with engineered features
- **Metaphor**: "Looking at a snapshot" of summary statistics
- **Pros**: Fast, robust, excellent at tabular data
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and trained

### Neural Networks (Future Work)
- **Input**: Rolling window sequences (samples, timesteps, features)
- **Metaphor**: "Watching a movie" of past days/weeks
- **Architectures**: LSTM, GRU, Temporal CNN, Transformer
- **Pros**: Learns temporal dependencies without manual feature engineering
- **Status**: ⏳ Can be added for ensemble

## Results

```
Cross-Validation Performance:
├── Fold 1: Corr = 0.904, RMSE = 0.00664
├── Fold 2: Corr = 0.973, RMSE = 0.00220
├── Fold 3: Corr = 0.979, RMSE = 0.00293
├── Fold 4: Corr = 0.991, RMSE = 0.00106
└── Fold 5: Corr = 0.987, RMSE = 0.00162

Average: Corr = 0.9667, RMSE = 0.002889
```

## Top Features

1. **zscore_60** - Most important (z-score over 60 days)
2. **zscore_20** - Short-term z-score
3. **zscore_40** - Medium-term z-score
4. **rank_60** - Percentile rank
5. **target_rolling_min_5** - Recent minimum return

**Key Insight**: Market predictions benefit most from understanding **relative position** (z-scores, ranks) rather than absolute values.

## Next Steps for Competition

### Immediate (Ready to submit)
1. Test `kaggle_submission.py` with Kaggle evaluation framework
2. Upload models and code to Kaggle notebook
3. Submit and monitor performance

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Add Neural Networks**: Implement LSTM/GRU for temporal modeling
2. **Ensemble**: Combine GBM + Neural Nets
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Optimize LightGBM params
4. **Feature selection**: Remove redundant features

### Long-term (During forecasting phase)
1. **Adaptive training**: Retrain on expanding window
2. **Regime detection**: Identify market regimes and adjust strategy
3. **Volatility targeting**: More sophisticated position sizing
4. **Model monitoring**: Track performance and retrain when needed

## Why This Works

1. **Strong feature engineering**: Z-scores capture market regimes
2. **Proper validation**: Time series CV prevents overfitting
3. **Clean data**: Used only periods with complete features
4. **Non-linear model**: LightGBM captures complex interactions
5. **Conservative approach**: Reasonable allocations, no extreme bets

## The Two Paradigms (Future Ensemble)

### Current: Gradient Boosting
```python
Input: [feature1, feature2, ..., feature160]
       ↓
Model: LightGBM decision trees
       ↓
Output: Predicted return
```

### Future: Neural Network
```python
Input: [[day_t-20_features], [day_t-19_features], ..., [day_t_features]]
       ↓
Model: LSTM/GRU layers
       ↓
Output: Predicted return
```

### Ensemble
```python
Prediction = 0.7 * GBM_pred + 0.3 * NN_pred
```

## Competition Context
